This is the first Project of the CS188 Berkeley Pacman Projects, which can be found at http://ai.berkeley.edu/classfication.html

The main aim of this project is to familiarize ourselves with the concepts of Artificial Neural Networks, gradient Descent, Backpropagation, Feature design and introduces the problem of Finding Islands. This whole project was done using TensorFlow and that made it even more fun.
